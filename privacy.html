  Privacy Policy

  Last updated: April 20, 2025
  
  This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.
  
  We use Your Personal data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, You agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  
  Interpretation and Definitions
  
  Interpretation
  The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following conditions. The following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or in plural.
  
  Definitions
  For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:
  
  Affiliate means an entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a party, where "control" means ownership of 50% or more of the shares, equity interest or other securities entitled to vote for election of directors or other managing authority.
  
  Application means the software program provided by the Company downloaded by You on any electronic device, named Animator.
  
  Company (referred to as either "the Company", "We", "Us" or "Our" in this Agreement) refers to Animator. For the purpose of the GDPR, the Company is the Data Controller.
  
  Data Controller, for the purposes of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), refers to the Company as the legal person which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data.
  
  Device means any device that can access the Service such as a computer, a cellphone or a digital tablet.
  
  Personal Data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. For the purposes of GDPR, Personal Data means any information relating to You such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.
  
  Service refers to the Application.
  
  Service Provider means any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the Company. It refers to third-party companies or individuals employed by the Company to facilitate the Service, to provide the Service on behalf of the Company, to perform services related to the Service or to assist the Company in analyzing how the Service is used. This includes third-party AI image generation services used by the Application. For the purpose of the GDPR, Service Providers are considered Data Processors.
  
  Third-Party AI Services refers to external services, such as OpenAI or Google Gemini, used by the Application to process images provided by You and generate stylistic results.
  
  Usage Data refers to data collected automatically, either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a feature use).
  
  You means the individual accessing or using the Service, or the company, or other legal entity on behalf of which such individual is accessing or using the Service, as applicable. Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), You can be referred to as the Data Subject or as the User as you are the individual using the Service.
  
  Collecting and Using Your Personal Data
  
  Types of Data Collected
  
  Personal Data
  We do not ask You to provide Us with personally identifiable information such as Your name or email address to use Our Service. The Application functions without user accounts. All user configuration data is stored locally on Your device.
  
  When You use the Service to generate images, You provide Us with images either from Your device's gallery or camera ("Image Data"). This Image Data is required for the core functionality of the Service.
  
  Usage Data
  Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service.
  Usage Data may include information such as Your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), device type, operating system, the features of our Service that You use, the time and date of Your use, the time spent on those features, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.
  
  When You access the Service by or through a mobile device, We may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device You use, Your mobile device unique ID, the IP address of Your mobile device, Your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser You use, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.
  
  Image Data
  When You use the Service's core feature, You select or capture an image. This Image Data is sent to Third-Party AI Services (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) for processing to generate the stylistic image output. We do not store Your Image Data on Our servers. The processing is done via the Third-Party AI Services.
  
  Use of Your Personal Data
  
  The Company may use Personal Data and Image Data for the following purposes:
  
  To provide and maintain our Service, including to monitor the usage of our Service and facilitate its core functionality.
  
  To process Your Image Data: To send Your Image Data to Third-Party AI Services to generate the stylistic images You request through the Service.
  
  To manage Your requests: To attend and manage Your requests to Us (e.g., support inquiries).
  
  For business transfers: We may use Your information to evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Usage Data held by Us about our Service users may be among the assets transferred. (Note: As we do not store Image Data, it would not be part of such a transfer).
  
  For other purposes: We may use Your information for other purposes, such as data analysis (using anonymized or aggregated Usage Data), identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of Service features and to evaluate and improve our Service, products, services, and your experience.
  
  Sharing Your Personal Information
  
  We may share Your personal information in the following situations:
  
  With Service Providers: We share Your Image Data with Third-Party AI Services (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini) solely for the purpose of generating the images requested by You through the Service. These providers process the data according to their own privacy policies. We may also share Usage Data with Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service, but only as necessary for the operation and improvement of the Service.
  
  For business transfers: We may share or transfer Your Usage Data in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of Company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of Our business to another company.
  
  With Affiliates: We may share Your information (primarily Usage Data) with Our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy. Affiliates include Our parent company and any other subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that We control or that are under common control with Us.
  
  With Your consent: We may disclose Your personal information for any other purpose with Your consent.
  
  Retention of Your Personal Data
  
  The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Specifically:
  
  Image Data: We do not retain Your Image Data. It is processed transiently by Third-Party AI Services to fulfill Your request and is not stored by Us.
  
  Usage Data: The Company will retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of Our Service, or We are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.
  
  We will retain and use Your Personal Data (primarily Usage Data) to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.
  
  Transfer of Your Personal Data
  
  Your information, including Usage Data and Image Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and by the Third-Party AI Services, which may be located anywhere in the world. It means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction.
  
  Specifically, sending Image Data to Third-Party AI Services (like OpenAI or Google Gemini) involves transferring that data to the locations where those services operate.
  
  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information represents Your agreement to that transfer.
  
  The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other personal information.
  
  Disclosure of Your Personal Data
  
  Business Transactions
  If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Usage Data may be transferred. We will provide notice if Your Personal Data becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy. As noted, Your Image Data is not stored by Us and would not be part of such a transfer.
  
  Law enforcement
  Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data (primarily Usage Data) if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).
  
  Other legal requirements
  The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
  
  Comply with a legal obligation
  
  Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
  
  Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
  
  Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
  
  Protect against legal liability
  
  Security of Your Personal Data
  
  The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us. We implement reasonable security measures to protect Usage Data. However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute security. The security of Your Image Data during processing by Third-Party AI Services is governed by their respective security practices.
  
  Detailed Information on the Processing of Your Personal Data
  
  The Service Providers We use may have access to Your Personal Data (Usage Data or Image Data as specified below). These third-party vendors collect, store, use, process and transfer information about Your activity on Our Service in accordance with their Privacy Policies.
  
  Image Processing Services
  We utilize Third-Party AI Services to perform the AI image generation. When you submit an image via the Application, it is transferred to these services for processing. Their use of your data is governed by their respective privacy policies. You should review their policies to understand how they handle Your Image Data.

  GDPR Privacy
  
  Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data under GDPR
  We may process Personal Data under the following conditions:
  
  Consent: You have given Your consent for processing Personal Data (including Image Data for generation) for one or more specific purposes by choosing to use the Service features.
  
  Performance of a contract: Provision of the Service functionality (processing images) constitutes performance of an implicit agreement with You based on Your use of the Application.
  
  Legal obligations: Processing Personal Data (primarily Usage Data) is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Company is subject.
  
  Vital interests: Processing Personal Data is necessary in order to protect Your vital interests or of another natural person.
  
  Public interests: Processing Personal Data is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Company.
  
  Legitimate interests: Processing Personal Data (like Usage Data for service improvement and security) is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Company, except where such interests are overridden by your data protection rights.
  
  In any case, the Company will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
  
  Your Rights under the GDPR
  The Company undertakes to respect the confidentiality of Your Personal Data and to guarantee You can exercise Your rights. You have the right under this Privacy Policy, and by law if You are within the EU, to:
  
  Request access to Your Personal Data. The right to access the information We hold about You. As we do not maintain user accounts or store Image Data, this primarily applies to Usage Data associated with your device identifiers. You can contact Us to request this information.
  
  Request correction of the Personal Data that We hold about You. You have the right to have any incomplete or inaccurate information We hold about You corrected.
  
  Object to processing of Your Personal Data. This right exists where We are relying on a legitimate interest as the legal basis for Our processing (e.g., processing Usage Data for analytics) and there is something about Your particular situation, which makes You want to object to our processing of Your Personal Data on this ground.
  
  Request erasure of Your Personal Data. You have the right to ask Us to delete or remove Personal Data (primarily Usage Data) when there is no good reason for Us to continue processing it. Note that we do not store your Image Data.
  
  Request the transfer of Your Personal Data. We will provide to You, or to a third-party You have chosen, Your relevant Personal Data (primarily Usage Data linked to you, if feasible) in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Please note that this right only applies to automated information which You initially provided consent for Us to use or where We used the information to perform a contract with You.
  
  Withdraw Your consent. You have the right to withdraw Your consent on using your Personal Data (e.g., consent to process images). If You withdraw Your consent for image processing, the core functionality of the Service will not be available. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
  
  Exercising of Your GDPR Data Protection Rights
  You may exercise Your rights of access, rectification, cancellation, and opposition by contacting Us using the contact details provided below. Please note that we may ask You to verify Your identity before responding to such requests. If You make a request, We will try our best to respond to You as soon as possible.
  
  You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about Our collection and use of Your Personal Data. For more information, if You are in the European Economic Area (EEA), please contact Your local data protection authority in the EEA.
  
  Children's Privacy
  
  Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. The Service is intended for users who are 18 years of age or older.
  
  If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child under 18 has provided Us with Personal Data (which would likely only be Usage Data or potentially Image Data if they used the app), please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 18 without verification of parental consent (where applicable by law, though our primary stance is the service is not for under 18s), We take steps to remove that information from Our servers or cease processing.
  
  If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information, although our service is not targeted at individuals requiring such consent.
  
  Links to Other Websites
  
  Our Service may contain links to other websites (such as the privacy policies of Third-Party AI Services) that are not operated by Us. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.
  
  We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
  
  Changes to this Privacy Policy
  
  We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Application or on this page.
  
  We may let You know via a notice on Our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the 'Last updated' date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
  
  You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
